# Flavour_metabolites
Scripts associated with the analysis of Lemna and Spirodela duckweed species and ecotypes scaled up for growth and nutritonal comparisons in a glasshouse experiment. 
Scripts relate to the following manuscript: "Aroma and metabolite profiling in duckweeds: exploring species and ecotypic variation to enable wider adoption as a food crop" available at: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jafr.2024.101263
The following scripts include analysis of the glasshouse environment, statistics and graphs for aroma and metabolite analysis and calculating vegetation indices from fieldspec data, including modelling between variables

R scripts are included for the following:

1. Glasshouse environment – temperature line plot, statistics of light.
2. Greenness and coverage between accessions
3. Volatilome – PCA and species boxplots.
4. Metabolites – Species boxplots.
5. Calculating vegetation indices from fieldspectrometer data.
6. PCA, corr plot and linear models all measured traits.
