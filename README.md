# Flavour_metabolites
Scripts associated with chapter six for the analysis of glasshouse environment data, flavour and metabolite analysis, calculating vegetation indices from fieldspec data, modelling between variables

R scripts for the following:

1. Glasshouse environment – temperature line plot, statistics of light.
2. Greenness and coverage between accessions
3. Volatilome – PCA and species boxplots.
4. Metabolites – Species boxplots.
5. Calculating vegetation indices from fieldspectrometer data.
6. PCA, corr plot and linear models all measured traits.
